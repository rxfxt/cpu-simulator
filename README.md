# cpu-simulator
 
Computer Architecture project to simulate a CPU, including memory and cache 

1. What does the program do?
Program will prompt user to point the program to two input files, the cpu instructions file as well as data input 

2. What data do you need?
Program needs CPU instructions as well as data input to initialize memory bus 

3. What aspects of a CPU can you simulate using Python?
The program can simulate a variety of ISA instructions including ADD, ADDI, CACHE, J and HALT

4. How will your CPU handle incoming instructions?
The cpu will receive the insructions from the cpu instructions file and run the appropriate ISA instructions

5. How will your CPU output instructions?
CPU will output instructions to the terminal
 
6. How will your CPU store data?
CPU will store the data in memory using the Memory class.
